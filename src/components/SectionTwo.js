                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p><span>Holistic</span> approach- we focus on the whole child and use In The Moment Planning and The Curiosity Approach to allow the child to progress at their own rate. We have done a lot of research on 'Natural' and 'minimal' distractions to aid each child individually.</p>
                <p><span>Outdoor</span> ethos-we have our own area outside designed to imitate Forest school to give each child an experience within the outside world. The 3 main rules are 'Look after yourself, look after your friends, Look after the forest'. Promoting a lot of learning and 'risky play' that cannot be offered inside. We also have another large outdoor space that we have free flowing access to, including vegetable plots and outdoor classrooms. We regularly take trips into the local community to encourage cultural experiences.</p>
                <p><span>Unique</span> learning opportunities-each key worker know their children 'inside out' and we moderate regularly to make sure this is correct. Next steps are focused on the needs of each individual child.</p>
                <p><span>Staff</span> that are nurturing- all staff have a great bond with their children and parents and spend a lot of time building this trust and connection. Parents are encouraged to discuss concerns and work as a team to offer the best possible opportunities for their child.</p>
                <p><span>Exciting</span> experiences-we offer lots of varieties of activities inside, outside and within the community for each child. We also offer extra opportunities such as French lessons, sports sessions, nativities.</p>
